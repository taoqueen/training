// sorry editor won't include html tags so just add first angle bracket to each tag "<" and i've put each tag on a new line to make it easy. each line should start with <

//save this as index.html. put it in a folder and call it whatever you want e.g. test.
//now create a new file called "this.css" in the same folder(test) and include this code;
body{background-color:yellow;}
p{color:red;}
